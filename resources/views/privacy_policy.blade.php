	    			<p>Our privacy policy and practices are detailed below. Please read them thoroughly.  We make three pledges to you: </p>
	    			<ul>
	    				<li>We will not release personally identifiable information about you without your permission (except as needed to provide to you the services you have expressly requested).</li>
	    				<li>You can manage and control the information that you have voluntarily provided to us. </li>
	    				<li>You can tell us what your privacy questions and concerns are so that we can respond. We constantly improve the tools you can use to manage the data that you provide to us. Please refer to this page from time to time to see these new features.</li>

	    			<h3>Helpful Definitions</h3>
	    			<p>Personally identifiable information is information, like your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address, that can be used to uniquely identify you.</p>
	    			<p>We will not share any anonymous information about the use of our site with third parties if we know that this information will be linked with your personally identifiable information obtained from another source, unless you have given us permission.</p>
	    			<p>Anonymous information is not personally identifiable information. Anonymous information is information about how you use our site (such as sites you visit and searches you do). Anonymous information also includes the domain names and/or I.P. addresses (as explained below) of internet browsers that visit our site, the time of day the site was visited, and other non-personal information. Anonymous information is information that is not tied to any person who is not registered as an FuturePointIndia.com member, but helps us know who what our users do (for example, the average stay on the Money channel lasts over 10 minutes).</p>

	    			<h2>Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information </h2>
	    			<h3>Registration</h3>
	    			<p>We want to assure you that you can visit our site and use many of our services without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself to us. It is only when you register to become an FuturePointIndia.com member that will you be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information.</p>
	    			<p>When you register with us, you need to complete certain fields (some are required and some are optional), as well as pick a first name and password. For example, we ask for information so we can contact you (like your first and last name, email address,and physical address). We use this information to tell you about new features and services available on our site </p>

	    			<h3>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties</h3>
	    			<p>We will not share your personally identifiable information unless you have authorized us to share it. Customers querying the database can reach for and find details from the online directory. They are then provided with details about you so as to enable them to reach you. They can use this information (sometimes, with other information they have about you)</p>
